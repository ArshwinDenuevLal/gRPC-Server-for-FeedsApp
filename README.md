# feeds.proto

let's discuss about the feed store proto.
feeds.proto is the protocol buffer definition file, which can be called as a blueprint or instruction manual for client server communication.  
This defines our service contract. Here, you can see the FeedsService with a single RPC method, GetFeeds. 
GetFeeds RPC takes a FeedsRequest and returns a FeedsResponse.


# Package.swift

    This is the manifest file for the Swift Package Manager. It declares the package's name, dependencies (like grpc-swift for gRPC functionality and ArgumentParser for command-line handling), build targets (your executable feeds), and required plugins (like the one to generate code from .proto files).

  - grpc-swift: Core gRPC Swift implementation
  - grpc-swift-protobuf: Protobuf plugin for generating Swift files
  - grpc-swift-nio-transport: NIO transport layer for gRPC
  - swift-argument-parser: CLI argument parser for Swift commands
  - grpc-swift-protobuf: Plugin used to auto-generate Swift source code from .proto files


# feeds.grpc.swift

    Generated by the gRPC Swift generator plugin for the protocol buffer compiler
    
    Command used:
    protoc --grpc-swift_out=. / /path/to/Feeds/protos/feeds.proto



# feeds.pb.swift

    Generated by the Swift generator plugin for the protocol buffer compiler.
    
    Command used:
    protoc --swift_out=. / /path/to/Feeds/protos/feeds.proto



# feeds.swift

    This is the main entry point for your command-line application. 
    It uses ArgumentParser to set up the command-line interface, defining the main command (feeds) and likely delegating to subcommands like Serve.


# Serve.swift

     This file defines the Serve command for your application. It's responsible for starting the actual gRPC server. It configures the server (like the port to listen on), registers the service implementation (ServiceHandler), and runs the server to handle incoming client requests.


# ServiceHandler.swift

     This class contains the server-side logic for your FeedsService. It implements the getFeeds function defined in the generated gRPC protocols. 
     When a client calls GetFeeds, the code in this file executes, reads the data from database and sends back the FeedsResponse.


# ClientArguments.swift

    This file defines the command-line arguments specifically for a potential client application (though the main focus seems to be the server). 
    It uses ArgumentParser to define options like the server port to connect to and the message to send.


# ClientService.swift 
    This class implements the client-side logic to interact with the gRPC FeedsService. 
    It contains methods to create a connection to the server, make the GetFeeds RPC call, handle the response, and manage the underlying gRPC client setup.
